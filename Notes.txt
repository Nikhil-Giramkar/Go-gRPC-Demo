In a REST or GraphQL architecture we have
    Client sending request
    Server giving response
But this process is
    Slow
    Synchronous
    Not Scalable
--------------------------------------------------------
How to make the client server intercation Scalable?

For that we use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

RPC directly calls functions from client to server
Instead of JSON, we use protobuf files
Here, payload size is small and accelerates communication

Client Server communication can happen via Streaming (sequences of mesages)
Stream is continous flow of data
Its asynchronous
Extremely scalable
Usecase: MICROSERVICES!, Blockchains
--------------------------------------------------------

There are mainly 4 types of communications in GRPC

1. Unary API
    Regular request-response

2. Server Streaming
    Client sends a request to server
    Server sends a strea of data to client 

3. Client Streaming
    Client sends a stream of data to server
    Server provides a siple response to client

4. Bi-Directional Streaming
    Both client and server can communicate via streaming.
    And they can do this parallely, 
    Not like request response wehre client sneds first and then server gives response - not like this.
    Its like a two way-traffic
    Even though its a stream, not a queue, sequence of messages is preserved
